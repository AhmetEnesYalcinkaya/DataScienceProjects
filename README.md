## [Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/AhmetEnesYalcinkaya/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb)

- 🚀 We examined Exploratory Data Analysis methods on Telecom churn data. Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

- In recent years, the telecom market has been very competitive. The cost of retaining existing telecom customers is lower than attracting new customers. It is necessary for a telecom company to understand customer churn through customer relationship management (CRM).

- The customer churn dataset is an open-source dataset that contains 20 features and 3333 observations. The feature ‘Churn’ shows customer churn or non-churn based on
existing conditions. Approximately 14.5% of the ‘Churn’ is ‘T’ label, and 84.5% of ‘nonchurn’ is ‘F’ label.
