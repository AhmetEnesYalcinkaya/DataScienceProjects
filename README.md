## [Project 1 - Exploratory Data Analysis](https://github.com/AhmetEnesYalcinkaya/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/ExploratoryDataAnalysis/ExploratoryDataAnalysis.ipynb)

- We examined Exploratory Data Analysis methods on Telecom churn data. Exploratory Data Analysis refers to the critical process of performing initial investigations on data so as to discover patterns,to spot anomalies,to test hypothesis and to check assumptions with the help of summary statistics and graphical representations.

- In recent years, the telecom market has been very competitive. The cost of retaining existing telecom customers is lower than attracting new customers. It is necessary for a telecom company to understand customer churn through customer relationship management (CRM).

- The customer churn dataset is an open-source dataset that contains 20 features and 3333 observations. The feature ‘Churn’ shows customer churn or non-churn based on
existing conditions. Approximately 14.5% of the ‘Churn’ is ‘T’ label, and 84.5% of ‘nonchurn’ is ‘F’ label.

## [Project 2- Customer Life Time Value (CLTV)](https://github.com/AhmetEnesYalcinkaya/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/CustomerLifeTimeValue-CLTV/customer_lifetime_value.ipynb)

This dataset contains a supermarket data in Turkish Language. There are more than 
- 600.000 sales rows, 
- contains 52.000+ unique Turkish customername,gender,age,birthdate etc.
- 9.000+ Categorized and subcategorized items with category1,category2,category3,category4
- 81 Stores
- 1200+ Salesman
- Geographic location information (Latitude, longitude)
- The data contains 3 month sales.

## [Project 3- Sales Analysis](https://github.com/AhmetEnesYalcinkaya/DataScienceProjects/blob/main/CustomerLifeTimeValue-CLTV/customer_lifetime_value.ipynb)

Our aim is create real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

We started by cleaning our data. This section includes;

- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Changing the type of columns

## ❓ **Exploration Section** 

- What was the best month for sales ?
- Which city sold the most product ?
- What time should we display advertisement to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying product ?
- Which products are most often sold together ?
- Which product sold the most ?


## 📝 **To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:**

- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs
