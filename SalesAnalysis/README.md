# Real World Data Science Task
## ‚òÄÔ∏è **Sales Analysis** 

Our aim is create real world data science tasks completed using the Python Pandas library.

We started by cleaning our data. This section includes;

- Drop NaN values from DataFrame
- Removing rows based on a condition
- Changing the type of columns

## ‚ùì **Exploration Section** 

- What was the best month for sales ?
- Which city sold the most product ?
- What time should we display advertisement to maximize the likelihood of customer's buying product ?
- Which products are most often sold together ?
- Which product sold the most ?


## üìù **To answer these questions we walk through many different pandas & matplotlib methods. They include:**

- Concatenating multiple csvs together to create a new DataFrame (pd.concat)
- Adding columns
- Parsing cells as strings to make new columns (.str)
- Using the .apply() method
- Using groupby to perform aggregate analysis
- Plotting bar charts and lines graphs to visualize our results
- Labeling our graphs
